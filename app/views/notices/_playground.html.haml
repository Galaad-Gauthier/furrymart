        Welcome to the <strong>Furry·Mart's playground</strong>! We magically assigned you a random account with a badass name so you can start to poke around
        right now. <strong>Feel free to do anything you want on the playground</strong> but remember that we reset everything every day!

        Once you're done, you can <strong><a href="https://furrymart.com/users/sign_up">join us</a></strong> anytime you want,
        it's free for both commissioners and artists ♥
